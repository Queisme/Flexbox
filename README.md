# Flexbox

Flexbox info

flex is shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis.

flex: 1; === flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0 === flex: 1 1 0;

~*Flex-grow*~ expects a single number as its value and that number is used as the flex-item's growth factor. 

flex:1 tells every div to grow the same amount. (Every div always ends up the exact same size)

flex:2 added to one of the divs tells that div to grow 2x the size of the others.

etc.

~*Flex-shrink*~ is similar to flex-grow but instead of setting the growth factor, it sets the shrink factor.
